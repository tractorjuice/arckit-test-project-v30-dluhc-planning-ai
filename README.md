# Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) — Planning & Housing Data Intelligence Platform

An architecture governance project using [ArcKit](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit) to design and govern the **Planning & Housing Data Intelligence Platform** for **Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities**.

## Background

The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) drives the levelling up agenda, housing delivery, and local government policy. The planning system processes hundreds of thousands of applications annually, housing delivery targets require data-driven monitoring, and levelling up metrics need real-time tracking. AI can transform planning efficiency, housing intelligence, and community investment decisions.

## Project Scope

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Planning Application AI** | NLP analysis of planning applications for automated screening and risk assessment |
| **Housing Supply Forecasting** | ML models for housing delivery prediction and land availability assessment |
| **Levelling Up Metrics** | AI-driven composite indicators for measuring levelling up progress across regions |
| **Local Authority Intelligence** | Automated analysis of local authority performance data and financial health |
| **Building Safety AI** | AI for building safety risk assessment and remediation prioritisation post-Grenfell |
| **Community Investment Analytics** | Data-driven identification of communities most in need of investment |
